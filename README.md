# Hardware/software co-design of RRT-Star robotics motion planning algorithm- (hardware acceleration of the RRT-Star algorithm)

A rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) is an algorithm designed to efficiently search nonconvex, high-dimensional spaces by randomly building a space-filling tree. However, the algorithm is computationally expensive. Reducing the cost would have a significant impact and benefit to the industry.

## GOAL
Improve the computation speed by over 1000%

HARDWARE: Zybo board, SOFTWARE: C++,HLS, Vivado, Vitis
